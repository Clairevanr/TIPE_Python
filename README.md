# Python TIPE project 

## Description

I designed this project for my TIPE back in classe prepa. My TIPE was entitled "Sizing a heat exchanger for Sea Water Air Conditionning". I conducted experiments on a prototype of heat exchanger to gather data on the cold loop and the hot loop: Input and Outpout temperatures, flow rate. I took the mesures for a certain amount of different flow rate, aiming at optimizing the process. 

This python project allowed me to process fluid dynamics practical and theoritical calculus on my datas and to draw the related graphics to :

-Experimentally check my equations to verify my hypothesis

-Calculate the character factor for each flow rate, allowing me to conclude on the efficiency of the mesured configuration

-Calculate the relative errors

-Confront my results with the theoritical correlations
